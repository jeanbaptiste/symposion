# INTERCESS(OR)S: people, animals, plants & artefacts transporting us to other dimensions.

### Atelier 16, Akademie Schloss Solitude, sunday 11th dec 2016, 11:30am-5pm

Human intercessors have many names in many cultures, psychopomp (psychopompos), aoidos (aèdes itinérants, Aöde), griots, chamans (shamans, shammane), conteurs ( storyteller,  geschichtenerzähler ) , bards (bardes, Βαρδοί αοιδοι πασα Γαλάταίσ) trobadors & trobairitz ( troubadours   ) gymnosophs, peripatetician, hermits, sadu, walkers & talkers, street performers, magicians, clowns, arlequins (harlekin)...

According to anthropologists like Descola, Diamond and Hamayon, they perpetuate animist practices and traditions of nomadic people before human domestication of animals & plants. They celebrate a mutualistic symbiosis through experience rather than through belief. It is their repetitive movements in a limited space that initiates an experience where they 'play' with us and with spirits. Like the shadows produced by a fire or some specific waves of music, these frequential patterns animate their stories, often taking the form of epic poetry. 

The epic is originally related to oral tradition, transmitted by itinerant, travelling people. It was simply told, or performed on a monocord music, sometimes sung. First a retranscription of recitated fragments, often from different sources, it became a genre in itself, the opus of only one author, who is still continuing to use knowledge coming from the oral tradition. Epics are the alive trace of a lived adventure of hunters / gatherers or of supra-natural experience of intercessors, fighting and frolicking with spirits on our behalf. Mircea Eliae, Carlos Castaneda or Gershom Sholem have narrated how intercessors - like hunters and gatherers - are walking with us through the forest, reminding us to find for the place to light the fire illuminating our fortune. 

Look how this journeyman illudes into the supra-natural while ^walking^ on a mandragore road ^talking^ to an alchemical trio of two persons & a dog.

Roberte hamayon, in http://haubooks.org/why-we-play/ (book accessible on the internet) details how Evenk culture (Tungus, Buryat) in Siberia is rich in epic poetry and "playing" practices. During the ancient shamanic rituals, the shaman had to make the participants “play” in several ways, and participate himself in various “games. They still encourage their children to train for these practices, which are also based on imitation of animal body language, and felt to contain ideal manly values. The shaman’s body language was intended to mimic animals (two species in particular) in two interdependent behaviors: repelling the rival and attracting the female. These were the two objectives, demanding a double virility on his behalf, both combative and sexual (she notes that Freud himself saw in the practice of wit a development of play (hostile and obscene wit).

Hamayon explains how "all the Tungusic groups claim that they have to “play” to live, and so that nature can live again." Play could mean :" to mimic animals, to dance, to wrestle, to jump, to provoke someone else, to enjoy oneself, or even to carry out a ritual act"(...) far from being a gratuitous and free amusement, 'play" had to have a positive “effect” on the state of things to come, which is why participation was mandatory. It aimed for action more than distraction. These games were not the result of individual initiatives. They expressed a social obligation and a cultural bias."

Shamans are women and men dressed in colourful silk garments. They have attributes such as metal items (shamans were master of fire) producing sound, but also staff decorated as animal heads that Hamayon describe as well in musical instruments in her CNRS music disc from 1973 ( CNRSMH http://archives.crem-cnrs.fr/archives/collections/CNRSMH_E_1973_011_001/ ). They bear attributes of animals they are supposed to hunt but only in appearance,, as Hamayon explains shaman are not pretending to be a dominant animal, they simulate, keeping always a distance with the role they incarnate: "Far from pretending to be an animal, the shaman hereby assumes an animal identity in addition to his own human identity, and demonstrates the corresponding behaviors and relationships. His simulation consists of giving to the spirits supposed to rule over game what Louis Marin ([1980] 2005: 72) calls an “effect of presence” among the participants.6 Where literature speaks of charisma, the Evenk people simply say that their shaman “plays well” if he manages to make the spirits of game present enough, in the frame of the ritual, for the people to think that he acts upon them.7 He must give an “effect of presence” to the spirits and an “effect of reality” to his interaction with them. In this respect, simulation foreshadows the hunt itself."

The rich variety of attributes and clothings of shamans are remarkable and a great source of inspiration.
