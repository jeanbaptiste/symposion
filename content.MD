# INTERCESS(OR)S: people, animals, plants, artefacts and machines transporting us to other dimensions.

### Atelier 16, Akademie Schloss Solitude, sunday 11th dec 2016, 11am-3pm

## PART 1 ( material thinking / pensée matérielle / materieller gedanken )

This intervention is the continuation of another one i initiated at PA-F some month ago in the context of an event entitled Morphogenesis of the Outside.

https://github.com/jeanbaptiste/paf/tree/master/summer2015

I tried at that time to confront my meditations on *dualism* to the participants by using the medium of a half-baked poetic performance given in the middle of the night, in pa-f chapel. I was reading and slamming the source code of a program that was simultaneously 'performed' in real-time by a computer, a LUA script interpreted by an experimental C software called "Glint" written by my friend Milo for live-coding and free software advocacy ( the entire software is not only common C distributed through the terms of the Gnu Public Licence, but it is made to be read and compiled by anyone, as an invitation to experiment on one's own the magic of computation). 

https://github.com/rvba/glint

Most of the people were half asleep during the performance, the disposal of the floor mat inviting them to do so, an hypnopompic setting, inspired by Bachelard radio show that listeners were supposed to listen just before falling asleep in their beds. I imagined that they did not really understand what i was saying, due not only to my poor elocution in english, but also to the fact that i was adressing a very complex question (dualism), using a constellation of complex terms coming from abstract mathematics (diffeomorphism) but also material sciences, anthropology, metaphysics, mystics, alchemy, craft, hacking, evolutionnary biology and of course skeptical philosophy. 

I used verbs like hacking, blending, agitating, encrypting, intricating, weaving, cyphering, entangling, percolating, un-dominating, representing, projecting, jamming, interlocking, exapting, knotting, blurring, smoothing, transforming the striated into the seamless, infinitizing... words like manifold, diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions, Liesegang rings, Bénard cells, Lasers, cloud formations in stripes or rolls, ripples in icicles, washboard patterns on dirtroads, dendrites in solidification, liquid crystals, solitons, sphere packing, cellular automata morphogenesis, tsimtsum, tohu-bohu, umwelt, umgebung, mesology, mediology, iridescence, camouflage, transparency, crypto-capitalism, power, shamanism, playing

                          *

       *

Placed in no particular order or pattern, these words were, with all due respect to Novalis, a kind of brouillon général (eines allgemeine brouillon), they were like dark stars in the low lit atmosphere of the chapel, resonating symbolically to the actual physical light of pixels forming a starfield projected around me. I actually spent some precious preceding weeks coding a entire font lib in LUA composed of these random pixel stars, inspired by the notion of syzygy, one of the intellectual apex of my previous pa-f discussions. This word, which greek origin means yoked together, is often used in reference to the Sun, Earth, and either the Moon or a planet, where the latter is in conjunction or opposition. Solar and lunar eclipses occur at times of syzygy, as do transits and occultations. The term is often applied when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction (new moon) or opposition (full moon).The word syzygy is often loosely used to describe interesting configurations of planets in general. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29

The day after, in the peacock room, i proposed a hands on workshop continuing to investigate "dualism" in terms of conjunction of two entities associated one with another. This material thinking activity allowed dancers, philosophers, singers and other non-electronic specialist to tinker with resonant circuits, literally connecting their electrical output to their input, like an ouroboros, a self-referential loop called by cybernetics feedback. The workshop was an oral discussion with some slides simultaneous to a practical soldering and assembling practice of building an electronic textile oscillator (NE555 based sonic circuit, in the spirit of Forrest Mims, APK and similar simple electric astable multivibrator). The limitations of the circuit in terms of sound production but also in terms of cognitive accessibiliy (the NE55 is a genuine 'blackbox' - we read the pages datasheet together) were contrasted by the desire and harmonic transe induced by the knowledge and sonic experience

## PART 2 ( epic / épopée / epos )
The epic is originally related to oral tradition, transmitted by itinerant, travelling people. It was simply told, or performed on a monocord music, sometimes sung. First a retranscription of recitated fragments, often from different sources, it became a genre in itself, the opus of only one author, who is still continuing to use knowledge coming from the oral tradition.

The machinery for dreaming planted in the human brain was not planted for nothing. That faculty, in alliance with the mystery of darkness, is the one great tube through which man communicates with the shadowy…the magnificent apparatus which forces the infinite into the chambers of a human brain, and throws dark reflections from eternities below all life upon the mirrors of the sleeping mind.

##### Jared Diamond
Guns, Germs, and Steel, his best-known book, was published in 1997 seek to answer the biggest question of post-Ice-Age human history: why Eurasian peoples, rather than peoples of other continents, became the ones to develop the ingredients of power (guns, germs, and steel) and to expand around the world.

The answer depends on a synthesis of four bodies of information, in the fields of social science, botany, zoology, and microbiology, applied to findings of archaeology, linguistics, and human genetics.  Many social scientists have studied the development of complex societies around the world, and the emergence of technology, writing, centralized government, economic specialization, and social stratification.  The conclusion of social scientists is that all of these developments required sedentary populous societies producing storable food surpluses capable of feeding not only the food producers themselves, but also capable of feeding full-time political leaders, merchants, scribes, and technology specialists. 

Until 11,000 years ago, all people everywhere on Earth were hunter/gatherers, living at modest population densities because the hunter/gatherer lifestyle yields only modest food quantities and little or no storable food surpluses.  (Some hunter/gatherers in especially productive environments became semi-sedentary and developed chiefs, but no hunter/gatherers went as far as developing kings, metal tools, or writing).  Beginning 11,000 years ago, it was the rise of food production (agriculture and herding), yielding 100 to 1,000 times more food per acre than the hunter/gatherer lifestyle, that fueled the rise of sedentary populous societies with storable food surpluses and all of their consequences.

Philosophy Between the Lines : The Lost History of Esoteric Writing

Philosophical esotericism - the practice of communicating one's unorthodox thoughts "between the lines"-was a common practice until the end of the eighteenth century. The famous Encyclopedie of Diderot, for instance, not only discusses this practice in over twenty different articles, but admits to employing it itself. The history of Western thought contains hundreds of such statements by major philosophers testifying to the use of esoteric writing in their own work or that of others. Despite this long and well-documented history, however, esotericism is often dismissed today as a rare occurrence. But by ignoring esotericism, we risk cutting ourselves off from a full understanding of Western philosophical thought. Arthur M. Melzer serves as our deeply knowledgeable guide in this capacious and engaging history of philosophical esotericism. Walking readers through both an ancient (Plato) and a modern (Machiavelli) esoteric work, he explains what esotericism is-and is not. It relies not on secret codes, but simply on a more intensive use of familiar rhetorical techniques like metaphor, irony, and insinuation. Melzer explores the various motives that led thinkers in many different times and places to engage in this strange practice, while also exploring the motives that led more recent thinkers not only to dislike and avoid this practice but to deny its very existence. In the book's final section, "A Beginner's Guide to Esoteric Reading," Melzer turns to how we might once again cultivate the long-forgotten art of reading esoteric works. Philosophy Between the Lines is the first comprehensive, book-length study of the history and theoretical basis of philosophical esotericism, and it provides a crucial guide to how many major writings-philosophical, but also theological, political, and literary-were composed prior to the nineteenth century

DIED AT PORT BOU (SPAIN) ON HIS WAY INTO FREEDOM

Baal Shem Tov >>> Samuel Joseph Agnon >>> Gershom Sholem >>> you

• Quand le Baal Shem Tov avait une tâche difficile à accomplir, il se rendait à un certain endroit dans la
forêt, allumait un feu et se plongeait dans une prière silencieuse. Et ce qu’il avait à accomplir se
réalisait.
• Quand, une génération plus tard, le Maggid de Mezeritch se trouva confronté à la même tâche, il se
rendit à ce même endroit dans la forêt et dit : «Nous ne savons plus allumer le feu, mais nous
savons encore dire la prière ».
Et ce qu’il avait à accomplir se réalisa.
• Une génération plus tard, Rabbi Moshe Leib de Sassov eut à accomplir la même tâche. Lui aussi alla
dans la forêt et dit : «Nous ne savons plus allumer le feu, nous ne connaissons plus les mystères
de la prière, mais nous connaissons encore l’endroit précis dans la forêt où cela se passait, et
cela doit suffire».
Et ce fut suffisant.
• Mais quand une autre génération fut passée et que Rabbi Israël de Rishin dut faire face à la même
tâche, il resta dans sa maison, assis sur son fauteuil, et dit : «Nous ne savons plus allumer le feu,
nous ne savons plus dire les prières, nous ne connaissons même plus l’endroit dans la forêt,
mais nous savons encore raconter l’histoire»

- When the baal Shem Tov had a difficult task to accomplish, he was going to a certain place in the forest, lighted up a fire and asked deeply and silently. Then, what he wanted to be accomplished would happen.
- When, a generation later, the Maggid from Mezeritch was confronted to the same task to accomplish, he went to the same place in the forest and said: " we did not know how to light up the fire, but we still know how to ask". Then what he had to accomplish would happen.
- Another generation later, Rav Moshe Leib from Sassov had to accomplish the same task. He went as well to the forest and said: " we don't know how to light up the fire, we don't know anymore the mystery of asking, but we still know the precise place in the forest where it used to take place, and it should be enough". And it was enough.
- But when another last generation had passed, and that Rav Israel from Rishin had to to face the same task, he stayed in his house, sitted in his armchair, and said: " We do not know how to light up the fire, we do not know how anymore how to ask, we don't even know where in the forest, but we still know how to tell the story"

#### Philippe Descola
Parmi les anthropologues contemporains, Philippe Descola, dans une vision globalisante voire universaliste, a redéfini l'animisme dans un ouvrage remarqué, Par-delà nature et culture (2005). Il se place pour cela dans la situation de l'Homme s'identifiant au monde suivant deux perspectives complémentaires : celle de son « intériorité » et celle de sa « physicalité » vis-à-vis des autres, humains et non humains.

L'animisme correspondrait à la perception d'une identité commune des intériorités des existants, humains et non humains, et à celle d'une identité distincte entre leurs physicalités. L'anthropologue décrit les trois autres « ontologies » qui suivent la perception d'une fusion ou d'une rupture entre intériorité et physicalité, et qui se nomment totémisme, analogisme et naturalisme ; les quatre modes (identité/rupture) * {intériorité/physicalité}) réunis auraient une vocation universelle, tout en revêtant diverses formes de cohabitation ou de dominance suivant les cultures (qu'elles soient archaïques, traditionnelles ou modernes).

Ainsi, pour Descola, l'animisme se caractérise ainsi. a) Ontologie. L'animisme repose sur cette affirmation : ressemblance des intériorités et différence des physicalités entre humains et non-humains (animaux, végétaux, esprits, objets). Les animaux, les plantes ont la même âme, intériorité (émotions, conscience, désirs, mémoire, aptitude à communiquer...) que les humains, ils ne s'en distinguent que par leurs corps et donc aussi par leurs moeurs, l'éthogramme, le mode de comportement spécialisé (p. 187, 190). Il y a, comme dans le totémisme, classification par prototype, c'est-à-dire à partir du modèle le plus représentatif, qui est, dans l'animisme, l'humain. "De même que l'animisme est anthropogénique parce qu'il emprunte aux humains le minimum indispensable pour que des non-humains puissent être traités comme des humains, le totémisme est cosmogénique car il fait procéder de groupes d'attributs cosmiques préexistants à la nature et à la culture tout ce qui est nécessaire pour que l'on ne puisse jamais démêler les parts respectives de ces deux hypostases dans la vie des collectifs". b) Géographie. L'animisme se rencontre "en Amazonie, dans l'aire arctique et circumpolaire ou dans les forêts de l'Asie du Sud-Est", chez les Pygmées. c) Notions. Métamorphose : les êtres ont la capacité de métamorphose, l'animal peut devenir homme et inversement. Un chamane huaorani d'Amazonie peut devenir jaguar (p. 344). Perspectivisme : comme l'écrit Viveiros de Castro, "les animaux (prédateurs) et les esprits voient les humains comme des animaux (des proies), tandis que les animaux (le gibier) voient les humains comme des esprits ou comme des animaux (prédateurs)." d) Religion. L'animisme ne consiste pas en croyances, mais en l'expérience qu'il y a des esprits avec lesquels on peut entrer en communication, par des rêves, par la parole... e) Sociabilité. Relations permanentes sur le registre de l'amitié, de l'alliance de mariage, de déférence vis-à-vis des anciens". Aussi, "sur tout son territoire on ne trouvera ni éleveurs exclusifs, ni castes d'artisans spécialisés, ni culte des ancêtres, ni lignages fonctionnant comme des personnes morales, ni démiurges créateurs, ni goût pour les patrimoines matériels, ni obsession de l'hérédité, ni flèche du temps, ni filiations démesurée, ni assemblées délibératives". f) Problèmes. Comment rendre compte de la forme non humaine des non-humains ? solution : la métamorphose.

CHRONICLE OF EVIDENCE

“Play” has intrigued me ever since I began working in the field of anthropology. “Games,” Naadam, was the name of the national holiday in Mongolia, the most striking ritual element of this Soviet satellite country that I discovered at the end of the 1960s. How could the “Three Manly Games”—wrestling, archery, horseracing—solemnly “played” from July 11 to July 14 in the capital city, and in a less formal manner elsewhere (districts and municipalities) during the rest of July, further the national cause? Before the advent of the communist regime, these Games were a major political ritual; they became the national holiday during the communist era, and have remained so ever since. Clearly, they were closer to the ancient Greco-Roman Games than to our common conception of play. For the Buryats, neighbor and kin to the Mongols living in the Lake Baikal area in southern Siberia, the “Bride’s Games” were a mandatory introduction to the wedding celebrations, as described in early twentieth-century ethnographic literature, and in the epics bards still used to sing. During the ancient shamanic rituals, the shaman had to make the participants “play” in several ways, and participate himself in various “games,” including the “head-butting game,” where he would mimic the powerful head-butts of the great horned ruminants. Yet the same verb “to play” was used just as well for the bird during his mating dance as for the pianist, the card player, or the actor on stage. The translations invariably and unhesitatingly gave the equivalent “play” (jouer in French, igrat’ in Russian). It soon appeared that highlighting a polysemy here was pointless. Under the name of “Games” that designates the holiday, wrestling stays wrestling, and racing, racing. The other autochthonous peoples of Siberia also organize their collective identity holidays around similar practices, and as such call upon a wide range of the vocabulary relating to “play.” They encourage their children to train for these practices, which are also based on imitation of animal body language, and felt to contain ideal manly values. It would also be pointless to invoke cultural proximity. There are clearly, from one people to another, beyond the terminological diversity, similarities in behavior and associated values. These suggest the underlying presence of a common notion, not necessarily named as such—at least not in homogeneous fashion—but of which “play” seems to be a convenient equivalent.

![](/dsc_6166.jpg)

I first addressed the topic of play in La Chasse à l’âme (Hamayon 1990a)2 without any real intention of constructing an object of research: it was a logical consequence of the analysis of the ritual vocabulary of shamanism. During the pre-Soviet era, the shaman’s body language was intended to mimic animals (two species in particular) in two interdependent behaviors: repelling the rival and attracting the female. These were the two objectives, demanding a double virility on his behalf, both combative and sexual. Back then, I did not know that Freud had singled out aggressiveness and sexuality as the two sources of inspiration for wit—in the form of hostile and obscene wit, respectively—and that he saw in the practice of wit a development of play (Freud). The fact remains that the aggregation of these two manly conducts within the Siberian Games showed their interdependence regarding the function of perpetuating the self. Herein lay the source of their power to represent identity. Since the participants had to wrestle and dance while modeling themselves on the same animal activities, the understanding of the autochthonous verbs for “playing” verbs fitted easily with those for “fighting” and “frolicking,” which also suited animal behavior. But was it possible to further our research by taking literally the verbs signifying “to play” in order to name the ritual act itself?

![](/artefacts.jpg)

I took that leap during a symposium on the subject of ritualization which gathered together anthropologists and ethologists (Hamayon 1995). If some “games” could have properties usually specific to rituals in Siberia, was it the same elsewhere? In many descriptions, “game” featured as a literal translation of an autochthonous term referring to a ritual or a ritual episode, but this fact was then blurred in the analysis. Why was that term so often judged awkward or unimportant in such a context, as if a link between the solemnity of the ritual and the casualness of the game could not or should not exist? As we asked this question, the extent of the main factor underlying this concealment would become apparent: the chronic condemnation, in the Christian Western world, of all that is play and game. Triggered by the fathers of the church and relayed by all the centralizing powers, this condemnation took twelve full centuries to produce its effect. Its history suggests that it was by separating games from one another—and, more precisely, by separating combat games from other types of games—that these powers were able to depreciate the common conception of “play.” “Play” found itself hereby downgraded to something frivolous and futile, insignificant, and suited for children. In the meantime, combat games developed separately under different names: military art, then sports. It appeared, therefore, that the question I used as a title for an article I wrote in 1995, limited to Siberian data—“Why do ‘games’ please the spirits and displease God?”— needed to be asked at a more general level.

![](/The_yard_leading_to_The_White_Sulde_Temple.jpg)

This depreciation of play, common to most centralizing powers, hints at the potential impact of the notion. “Playing,” within the framework of Siberian and Mongolian collective rituals, did indeed imply a homology between humans and the immaterial entities supposed to hold their sources of subsistence which placed them in a partner/opponent relationship (Hamayon 2001a). And it is precisely the egalitarian nature of the playing relation that upsets the hierarchical structure of the centralizing power that crowns society. Furthermore, owing to the latitude required for its fulfillment, play conflicts with the normative trait of a centralizing system. To maintain itself, the latter must exclude all that is imponderable from collective demonstrations. Our analyses confirm that it really was the nature of “play,” and of the acts performed as such, that motivated the church’s hostility, rather than the pagan belief that a ritual “game” could, for instance, make the rain fall. For the church also needed the believer to actually believe. However—and here lies an irony within our mental mechanisms—it is the ability to make the subject “knower and dupe at once,” according to Johan Huizinga’s expression ), that religious belief may have in common with the “entry into the game” (etymology of “illusion”). Whether he plays or whether he believes, by definition, the realm he enters into hereafter differs from empirical reality.

![](/fire.jpeg)

Before following this path, I had to widen my search base. This was the goal of a fruitful collective work, the results of which are compiled in Jeux rituels.3 For my part, the analysis of data originating from the Tungusic and Turkic branches of the Altaic family, alongside the data already collected from the Mongolian branch, would enable me to establish the presence of the “play” notion within the ritual vocabulary of the entire area (Hamayon 1999–2000: 11–45). All the Tungusic groups claim that they have to “play” to live, and so that nature can live again. And the Turkic world (including Islamized Central Asia) uses the same root -oy, “play,” all across its vast area, to say: to mimic animals, to dance, to wrestle, to jump, to provoke someone else, to enjoy oneself, or even to carry out a ritual act. However, meaningful historical and contextual variations began to appear. For instance, the Buryat use of “play” slowly shifts, during the twentieth century, from dance to sports. At the same time in Central Asia, ritual “play” often includes both a shamanic armed struggle against the spirits and a Sufi round dance, but without the shaman dancing, and without anyone else but him fighting. While both these gestural behaviors belong to the “play” kind in the ritual context, this does not apply to singing, nor to instrumental music, which become independent in the prevailing Muslim culture. To summarize, in the understanding of ritual “play” in the Altaic world, a certain primacy was granted to gesture at the expense of sound and voice accompaniment. Tracing further, from various perspectives, the reach of this primacy in three more studies (Hamayon 2003, 2006, 2008), I noticed that the gestural component was an essential frame for the “effect” expected of the ritual “play” on the renewing of nature, the success of the hunting season, or the recovery of an ill person.

![](/r2.jpg)

So that play may have such an effect, one must believe in it. A study carried out in the meantime on the notion of belief led me to spontaneously adopt the parallel between the player’s and the believer’s attitude, whether the object of belief is religious or not. In the believer’s commitment, doubt—a core part of the attitude of belief—plays a part similar to indeterminacy in a game, which explains the variations in a player’s commitment. Doubt stretches out in a continuum from a pole of compliance to a pole of detachment. Sliding from one pole to the other, both the believer’s doubt and the player’s variable involvement become, in a way, the driving forces of a speculative movement that pushes them forward. This accounts for how the “entry into the game” (the illusio), on the one hand, and the will to believe, on the other, are linked to an enigmatic and immaterial good called “luck” in some contexts, “grace,” “destiny,” “fortune,” and “happiness” in others, or, in other contexts still, “godsend” and “providence,” for instance. This kind of immaterial good differs from randomness by predicating the existence of an exterior “other” endowed with intentionality.

![](/dsc_6148.jpg)

Finally, these Games seem incompatible with the common understanding of the notion: far from being a gratuitous and free amusement, they had to have a positive “effect” on the state of things to come, which is why participation was mandatory. They aimed for action more than distraction. They were not the result of individual initiatives. They expressed a social obligation and a cultural bias.

Privilege not of a social class but:
- privilège of divination
- privilège of propitiation
- privilège of telling the future

We all know this middle zone where dreams nurture our thoughts and where our thoughts light up our senses. We are awaken sleepers, lucid dreamers, we live an instant as if the human dimension was getting bigger inside us. We explain to ourselves our own mystery.
